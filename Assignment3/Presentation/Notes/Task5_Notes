One sided communication:

realized by MPI 2 standard via Remote Memory Access (RMA)

all Operations:
-> (2) slide 6

useful Operations?
MPI_Get/MPI_Put -> non blocking
MPI_Win_create, MPI_Win_free -> create and delete shared memory region
MPI_Win_fence -> for synchronization ("In a simple word, between two MPI_Win_fence calls, all RMA operations are completed.")
