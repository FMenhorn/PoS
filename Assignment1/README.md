# How to use
The two lulesh folders exist for building the lules executable. Using the provided Makefiles from TaskX_X the executables are directly generated in the respective folder. **Important:** Only use the EXPERIMENTAL folder if you are playing around and trying stuff. The PRODUCTION folder contains the executables, which might be needed for running jobs. Please check ```llq``` before ```make clean``` in this folder.
